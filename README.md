# EyesProject
Eye movement with Javascript

# What Is It?
This project uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to simulate eye movement. Load the page and watch the eyes follow the cursor. <br> *See screenshot below*

# How to Run
Copy and paste marisela-ruiz.github.io/PacMenExercise/ into your browser and begin the fun! Alternatively, you can download all files from this repository. Be sure to store all files in the same directory/folder. Load the index.html file and create your PacMen! 

# Future Improvements
A fun improvement would be to change the cursor to an image of a cookie. Updated facial features will be a fun feature to add as well.
